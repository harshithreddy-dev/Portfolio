      Hey! I’m Harshith 😎 — a tech-savvy content creator, AI enthusiast 🤖, and all-out hustler 💪.

I love building things that look amazing and actually work 💻🎨. When I’m not designing or coding, you’ll find me at the gym 🏋️, shooting hoops 🏀, or cooking up my next big idea 💡.

My vibe? Creativity meets tech — making portfolios that wow, content that sticks, and exploring the endless possibilities of AI 🌐.

Goal: To create a lifestyle where I can work, travel, and grow without limits ✈️🔥.
